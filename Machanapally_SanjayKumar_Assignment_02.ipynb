            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as

nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film this film is not for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers honestly i cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers even the slightest hint will ruin the experience the viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues however nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where inception shines it is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come thats right yearsonce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time this is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future this is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows avatar be damnedof course a film is not complete without the actors leo dicaprio delivers an oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort shutter island he shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons joseph gordonlevitt ellen page tom hardy ken watanabe dileep rao cillian murphy tom berenger michael caine marion cottilard pete postlethwaite lukas haas nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownnolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film his direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating the detailed and complex original script is no surprise from nolan considering the fact that he turned batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago the dark knight the action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds the visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch the cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations hans zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all i have to say together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearchristopher nolan has once again outdone himself he truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in hollywood today and inception can proudly stand alongside blade runner and  a space odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherthere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct movie magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots movie of summer  movie of  heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade nolan is a genius and i applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peoplemissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeoverall value  excellent\n",

            " i have been reading nothing but good reviews on inception these past few weeks now i knew from the minute i saw the trailer i had to see this movie but i didnt know what to expect if you have seen the trailer to this movie you know that it doesnt explain too much but i saw inception today and all i can say is wow with an incredible cast and amazing director you just cant go wrong inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen its a very clever story that is told with skill and passion while you do have to pay attention i loved that it made me think one of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it but i didnt get that when i saw it today but i would love to see the movie again i have no problem with that between the performances the story the sounds the editing and the incredible effects i would love to watch this movie over and over again its my favorite film of the year so fardom cobb is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved now cobb is being offered a chance at redemption one last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception he gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off teaching new comer ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams even after all the lessons instead of the perfect heist cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant oneto write a dream is a riddle i love the way this movie was written christopher nolan is one of my new favorite directors he knows exactly how to write and tell a story the only small flaw this is a very small complaint is that his stories while theyre incredible can also be a bit exhausting this film is a bit long to warn you in advance its a little over two and a half hours long i felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed but like i said its such a small complaint because inception intrigued me so much to say that this film will be a contender for the oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound script editing and effects hopefully i think it might be a runner up for best pictureone of the things i hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because i dont want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it but honestly i dont think there isnt one person i wouldnt recommend this movie too inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing the matrix and the dark knight i think the zero gravity fight scene is one of the most amazing moments ive seen on the big screen i loved how the story kept you thinking and going guessing what would happen next and what was going on a dream within a dream within a dream you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality with a great cast and excellent director inception is everything i wanted and more once again nolan created a masterpiece something from his own mind inception questions yours and makes you wonder which world you are part of\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and

            " my rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardfor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent  years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable worksmemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inceptionspoilers ahead  for all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the  biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these  layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and  A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer  Movie of  Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent

            " im nearly at a loss for words just when you thought christopher nolan couldnt follow up to the dark knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next that is a real powerful skill a director has no wonder warner bros put their trust in him he is that good of a director and overhyping a christopher nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like many films beforenot since the eras of stanley kubrick andrei tarkovsky and alfred hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than christopher nolan he is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and gifted hollywood filmmakers in history filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime he has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time and yes it is similar to the excellent anime film paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as nolan brings the film to a whole different levelvisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts gi joe transformers or the exact opposite doubt invictus in this film the excellently

            " inception is written produced and directed by christopher nolan the film stars leonardo dicaprio ken watanabe joseph gordonlevitt marion cotillard ellen page tom hardy cillian murphy dileep rao tom berenger and michael caine the musical score is by hans zimmer and wally pfister is the cinematographer plot finds dicaprio playing dom cobb a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people but one day he gets a different offer one that will enable him to see his estranged children to get his reward he must enact inception the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target but inception is thought impossible and should cobb and his selected team fail the consequences are unthinkablethere has already been much written and pondered about as regards inception in the relatively short running time of its life one can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time for although its arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of  a space odyssey its inescapable that nolans movie is this current generations scifi classic that nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanshipinception is a film that its better to know nothing about before venturing into it and then it asks well nolan asks for your undivided attention its neither as confusing as some have painted it nor does it have any trickspeek behind the curtain typeup its sleeve the truth is is that inception has something for everyone thematically speaking and thats before we pore over the special effects that sees nolan raising the bar considerably as is the case with twisty high concept movies interpretations are many with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie what forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over theres also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with that of course wont work for everyone but that is just one of many strands that nolan dangles for the discerning viewerif that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the super hero genre rest assured thrill seekers inception is also a loud swirly spectacle the action is raucous be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled rollercoaster ride aided superbly by lee smiths editing and pfisters perfectly broad photography while zimmers score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains exsmiths guitarist johnny marr on  string to craft one of the best scores of  as i said theres something for everyone here making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbusterthen theres the strong ensemble cast led by a quite scintillating performance from dicaprio following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in shutter island dicaprio has given  two of its best lead performances here he gives real depth of emotion the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on his unfussy acting is easy to buy into giving the character the air of believability he is the glue that binds the whole film together murphy is wonderfully vulnerable very much an axis in the narrative while levitt almost usurps dicaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it special praise too for ellen page still in her early s she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress hands while hardy provides brawny levity and berenger leaves a favourable markthe matrix meets heat and mission impossible only its written by phillip k dick and richard matheson or something like that a cracking hybrid movie thats fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings \n",

            " i saw memento very recently something that turned out to be a great missi saw it again just to make a couple of thins straightand ill definitely do the same with inceptionchristopher nolan keeps improving himself with even more complex and multilayer script like thisand i thought memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers but noinception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius thats hidden behind itand not just directors and screenwriters or with other wordsnolan but with acting and soundand effects and editing as wellwhen you have a cast like thisi mean leonardo dicaprio joseph gordonlewitt michael caine or marion cotillard a personal favourite the movie just keeps going flawlesslymost of the crew is the same the nolan brothers worked with on tdk and earlier in batman beginsso the oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for methe only thing one could have against the movie is the headache one could havesee most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action they enjoyed iron man  and the ateam but this movieyou have to see it at least twice to understand itthe levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many that one surelyll miss something vitalthis is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience but i hope that wont happen because nolan is one of my favourite directorswriters and he showed that the brainless action flicks arent all of itthere are still movies like inception out there and still people like the nolans to make those movies so its not all lostand i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive not the endless constant explosionsbecause this is really a one of a lifetime eventsaying that i must say that in a world full of remakes reboots sequels prequels and god knows what this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so fara strong movie that surely will be nolans latest masterpiece my grade wont changeits the same for all nolan moviessheer \n",

            " surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely on the viewers intellect though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a pandoras box making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible this facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors but not to the genius of christopher nolan who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of science fiction in his latest wonder named inception nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called memento he further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like insomnia the prestige batman begins and the dark knight his unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag which gave him the carte blanche that a storyteller like nolan desperately needs its highly apparent that nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming inception inception is not only dreamlike but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen with its entwined layers the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential it incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts in fact the balance between human emotions and the elements of science fiction is so adequate that its impossible to separate themthe movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious in the dream state his proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wifes untimely death he is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children his only chance for redemption lies with a japanese tycoon named saitu who wants him to do an inception planting information into someones mind in order to accomplish this unprecedented task cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundityleonardo dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role following his memorable performance in shutter island he has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of cobbs enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma marion cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as cobbs whimsical wife mal the rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of ken watanabe ellen page and joseph gordonlevittinception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema nolans creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet but whether it would become buñuels un chien andalou or kubricks  a space odyssey and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide irrespectively inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado but also for the average viewer who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delightps one has to imagine it to believe it httpwwwapotpourriofvestigescom\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird inception is no exception to that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion ie the matrix  the cell  abre los ojos   its american remake vanilla sky  you really cant look away nor should youinception is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the summer of  that lives up to its hype it is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll the less you know about this movie going in the more you will be entranced by seeing itleonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb a world class criminal who with the help of a team of sleep experts works his way into peoples subconscious and steals what people value most ideas directly from their minds in his last assignment to possibly clear his name he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone but to plant one inside that persons mind the difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being takenthat plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe dicaprio is good in his role but unlike many other films he has starred in this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other costar instead this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist joseph gordonlevitt ellen page and tom hardy are especially good in their rolesthe special effects in this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the matrix movies there are slowmotion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences its especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams and impossible sequences are filmed in a way ive never seen other than in drawingshowever the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasnt good for this reason even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film the credit here can be given to writer and director christopher nolan who has not made a bad film yet there are many twists and turns in this film but nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story if nolan does not get nominated for best director andor best original screenplay next oscar season there is something terribly wrong with the academythat being said there was still a lot about this film i still dont get and may require multiple viewings to better understand however some of the best films ive seen are confusing at first  a space odyssey  is a film ive seen a couple of times and still dont understand completely it still has a major following though as im positive this movie will its an incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as

            " id like to keep my review rather to the pointpros  its theme  dream is a fascinating topic to say the least there are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld its plot  there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns its edgy drive  although you know whats coming next still you feel jumpy about it when it does its rapid storyline  the story moves fast from one scene to another making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride at times its hard to keep up even after watching it several times its sophistication  there is a lot of information to remember and digest this is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after i believe its realism  okay pun intended the movie explains or at least tries to the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions some of which are very familiar with and dear to uscons  its poor character development  although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development i wonder how many people really felt connected to the main characters after watching the movie yes the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else if you ask me too many distractions  i found that the movie had more characters than necessary they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else i wish the movie was more focused a bit preachy  i noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie im afraid inception overused this trickin conclusion its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvementi highly recommend you to go and read somewhere carnal over  winks if you dig this kind of flickscheers\n",

            " the film is a disappointment because it did so little with so much basically what you have here is a very interesting scifi heist premise cobb leonardo dicaprio and arthur joseph gordonlevitt are partners who use dreaminvasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise while they doze in exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against cobb they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission to practice inception on a powerful business scion that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulationall of this is great but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight to find that we have to look into the mystery of why cobb has been in exile and this plot has to do with his wife marion cotillard with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing this is to me where the movie essentially falls apart it seems like nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa at no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa and in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where cobb shows his new assistant ariadne ellen page too green to hold up her role a lot of the action becomes outright tedious never more so than when were treated to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snowmobile and gunfight action right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax it all starts to feel very obligatory and nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like funas a basic actionheist movie with scifi premise it still works well enough that i would recommend it as a rental nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level such as the association with totems and icons the spinning wheel etc and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity however when all the pieces are laid out the film seems overly simple and mechanical the plot is just this  the guy takes a job he does the job he gets to reunite with his kids although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to cillian murphys character even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of ken watanabes character i was hoping that some larger picture would emerge but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic the constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel i was watching a bad spielberg film the entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true spielberg fashion if you dont buy into this ridiculous softtarget hook then the whole film collapses like dicaprios dream worldthis isnt a bad or stupid film but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor which is almost always missing from nolans films the characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously basically this is like total recall in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes except that it takes itself hugely seriously it does not become a better film by doing so nor a more intelligent one\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " this review is being written by a  yearold guy i mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie moreand can take the fastpaced action and frenetic pace i assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film just something to consider as you read thisas for the movie ill be up front about the fact that i did not love this film its just not the sort of movie id usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go i am glad i did however as i really could respect the movie in many ways first the story is wildly original though also quite confusing other than the matrix films i cant think of anything that even comes close to it in style second the production looked and sounded great the music was intense and worked great with the amazing totally amazing special effects third it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are not lightweights and could act leonardo dicaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in titanichis maturity and grit were welcome also seeing the kid from third rock suddenly playing an action hero was greatyoud barely recognize himor the other grown child actors fourth i loved the endingit really pulled everything together very wellso why am i not giving the film a glowing review well i am simply not an action film fan and the insane pace tons of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times i much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film also while ken watanabe is a fine actor i had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he saidto the point where i wish theyd either dubbed him or had caption now this is not just because i am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearingmy daughter too found his thick accent difficult on the other hand ms cotillard was very easy to understand and i was surprised how well she controlled her lovely french accenti could probably go on and on about the filmas its long complex and very prone to be one to watch and rewatch and discuss with friends however at this point there are already a bazillion reviews and  billion people have already gone to see it so ill call it a daywell worth seeingbut perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future this is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows avatar be damnedof course a film is not complete without the actors leo dicaprio delivers an oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort shutter island he shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons joseph gordonlevitt ellen page tom hardy ken watanabe dileep rao cillian murphy tom berenger michael caine marion cottilard pete postlethwaite lukas haas nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownnolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film his direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating the detailed and complex original script is no surprise from nolan considering the fact that he turned batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago the dark knight the action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds the visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch the cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations hans zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all i have to say together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearchristopher nolan has once again outdone himself he truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in hollywood today and inception can proudly stand alongside blade runner and  a space odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherthere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct movie magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots movie of summer  movie of  heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade nolan is a genius and i applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peoplemissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeoverall value  excellent\n",

            " i have been reading nothing but good reviews on inception these past few weeks now i knew from the minute i saw the trailer i had to see this movie but i didnt know what to expect if you have seen the trailer to this movie you know that it doesnt explain too much but i saw inception today and all i can say is wow with an incredible cast and amazing director you just cant go wrong inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen its a very clever story that is told with skill and passion while you do have to pay attention i loved that it made me think one of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it but i didnt get that when i saw it today but i would love to see the movie again i have no problem with that between the performances the story the sounds the editing and the incredible effects i would love to watch this movie over and over again its my favorite film of the year so fardom cobb is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved now cobb is being offered a chance at redemption one last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception he gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off teaching new comer ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams even after all the lessons instead of the perfect heist cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant oneto write a dream is a riddle i love the way this movie was written christopher nolan is one of my new favorite directors he knows exactly how to write and tell a story the only small flaw this is a very small complaint is that his stories while theyre incredible can also be a bit exhausting this film is a bit long to warn you in advance its a little over two and a half hours long i felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed but like i said its such a small complaint because inception intrigued me so much to say that this film will be a contender for the oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound script editing and effects hopefully i think it might be a runner up for best pictureone of the things i hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because i dont want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it but honestly i dont think there isnt one person i wouldnt recommend this movie too inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing the matrix and the dark knight i think the zero gravity fight scene is one of the most amazing moments ive seen on the big screen i loved how the story kept you thinking and going guessing what would happen next and what was going on a dream within a dream within a dream you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality with a great cast and excellent director inception is everything i wanted and more once again nolan created a masterpiece something from his own mind inception questions yours and makes you wonder which world you are part of\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and

            " my rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardfor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent  years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable worksmemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inceptionspoilers ahead  for all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the  biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these  layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and  A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer  Movie of  Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent

            " im nearly at a loss for words just when you thought christopher nolan couldnt follow up to the dark knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next that is a real powerful skill a director has no wonder warner bros put their trust in him he is that good of a director and overhyping a christopher nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like many films beforenot since the eras of stanley kubrick andrei tarkovsky and alfred hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than christopher nolan he is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and gifted hollywood filmmakers in history filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime he has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time and yes it is similar to the excellent anime film paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as nolan brings the film to a whole different levelvisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts gi joe transformers or the exact opposite doubt invictus in this film the excellently

            " inception is written produced and directed by christopher nolan the film stars leonardo dicaprio ken watanabe joseph gordonlevitt marion cotillard ellen page tom hardy cillian murphy dileep rao tom berenger and michael caine the musical score is by hans zimmer and wally pfister is the cinematographer plot finds dicaprio playing dom cobb a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people but one day he gets a different offer one that will enable him to see his estranged children to get his reward he must enact inception the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target but inception is thought impossible and should cobb and his selected team fail the consequences are unthinkablethere has already been much written and pondered about as regards inception in the relatively short running time of its life one can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time for although its arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of  a space odyssey its inescapable that nolans movie is this current generations scifi classic that nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanshipinception is a film that its better to know nothing about before venturing into it and then it asks well nolan asks for your undivided attention its neither as confusing as some have painted it nor does it have any trickspeek behind the curtain typeup its sleeve the truth is is that inception has something for everyone thematically speaking and thats before we pore over the special effects that sees nolan raising the bar considerably as is the case with twisty high concept movies interpretations are many with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie what forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over theres also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with that of course wont work for everyone but that is just one of many strands that nolan dangles for the discerning viewerif that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the super hero genre rest assured thrill seekers inception is also a loud swirly spectacle the action is raucous be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled rollercoaster ride aided superbly by lee smiths editing and pfisters perfectly broad photography while zimmers score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains exsmiths guitarist johnny marr on  string to craft one of the best scores of  as i said theres something for everyone here making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbusterthen theres the strong ensemble cast led by a quite scintillating performance from dicaprio following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in shutter island dicaprio has given  two of its best lead performances here he gives real depth of emotion the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on his unfussy acting is easy to buy into giving the character the air of believability he is the glue that binds the whole film together murphy is wonderfully vulnerable very much an axis in the narrative while levitt almost usurps dicaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it special praise too for ellen page still in her early s she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress hands while hardy provides brawny levity and berenger leaves a favourable markthe matrix meets heat and mission impossible only its written by phillip k dick and richard matheson or something like that a cracking hybrid movie thats fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings \n",

            " i saw memento very recently something that turned out to be a great missi saw it again just to make a couple of thins straightand ill definitely do the same with inceptionchristopher nolan keeps improving himself with even more complex and multilayer script like thisand i thought memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers but noinception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius thats hidden behind itand not just directors and screenwriters or with other wordsnolan but with acting and soundand effects and editing as wellwhen you have a cast like thisi mean leonardo dicaprio joseph gordonlewitt michael caine or marion cotillard a personal favourite the movie just keeps going flawlesslymost of the crew is the same the nolan brothers worked with on tdk and earlier in batman beginsso the oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for methe only thing one could have against the movie is the headache one could havesee most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action they enjoyed iron man  and the ateam but this movieyou have to see it at least twice to understand itthe levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many that one surelyll miss something vitalthis is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience but i hope that wont happen because nolan is one of my favourite directorswriters and he showed that the brainless action flicks arent all of itthere are still movies like inception out there and still people like the nolans to make those movies so its not all lostand i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive not the endless constant explosionsbecause this is really a one of a lifetime eventsaying that i must say that in a world full of remakes reboots sequels prequels and god knows what this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so fara strong movie that surely will be nolans latest masterpiece my grade wont changeits the same for all nolan moviessheer \n",

            " surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely on the viewers intellect though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a pandoras box making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible this facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors but not to the genius of christopher nolan who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of science fiction in his latest wonder named inception nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called memento he further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like insomnia the prestige batman begins and the dark knight his unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag which gave him the carte blanche that a storyteller like nolan desperately needs its highly apparent that nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming inception inception is not only dreamlike but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen with its entwined layers the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential it incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts in fact the balance between human emotions and the elements of science fiction is so adequate that its impossible to separate themthe movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious in the dream state his proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wifes untimely death he is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children his only chance for redemption lies with a japanese tycoon named saitu who wants him to do an inception planting information into someones mind in order to accomplish this unprecedented task cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundityleonardo dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role following his memorable performance in shutter island he has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of cobbs enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma marion cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as cobbs whimsical wife mal the rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of ken watanabe ellen page and joseph gordonlevittinception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema nolans creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet but whether it would become buñuels un chien andalou or kubricks  a space odyssey and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide irrespectively inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado but also for the average viewer who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delightps one has to imagine it to believe it httpwwwapotpourriofvestigescom\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird inception is no exception to that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion ie the matrix  the cell  abre los ojos   its american remake vanilla sky  you really cant look away nor should youinception is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the summer of  that lives up to its hype it is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll the less you know about this movie going in the more you will be entranced by seeing itleonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb a world class criminal who with the help of a team of sleep experts works his way into peoples subconscious and steals what people value most ideas directly from their minds in his last assignment to possibly clear his name he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone but to plant one inside that persons mind the difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being takenthat plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe dicaprio is good in his role but unlike many other films he has starred in this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other costar instead this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist joseph gordonlevitt ellen page and tom hardy are especially good in their rolesthe special effects in this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the matrix movies there are slowmotion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences its especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams and impossible sequences are filmed in a way ive never seen other than in drawingshowever the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasnt good for this reason even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film the credit here can be given to writer and director christopher nolan who has not made a bad film yet there are many twists and turns in this film but nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story if nolan does not get nominated for best director andor best original screenplay next oscar season there is something terribly wrong with the academythat being said there was still a lot about this film i still dont get and may require multiple viewings to better understand however some of the best films ive seen are confusing at first  a space odyssey  is a film ive seen a couple of times and still dont understand completely it still has a major following though as im positive this movie will its an incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as

            " id like to keep my review rather to the pointpros  its theme  dream is a fascinating topic to say the least there are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld its plot  there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns its edgy drive  although you know whats coming next still you feel jumpy about it when it does its rapid storyline  the story moves fast from one scene to another making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride at times its hard to keep up even after watching it several times its sophistication  there is a lot of information to remember and digest this is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after i believe its realism  okay pun intended the movie explains or at least tries to the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions some of which are very familiar with and dear to uscons  its poor character development  although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development i wonder how many people really felt connected to the main characters after watching the movie yes the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else if you ask me too many distractions  i found that the movie had more characters than necessary they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else i wish the movie was more focused a bit preachy  i noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie im afraid inception overused this trickin conclusion its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvementi highly recommend you to go and read somewhere carnal over  winks if you dig this kind of flickscheers\n",

            " the film is a disappointment because it did so little with so much basically what you have here is a very interesting scifi heist premise cobb leonardo dicaprio and arthur joseph gordonlevitt are partners who use dreaminvasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise while they doze in exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against cobb they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission to practice inception on a powerful business scion that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulationall of this is great but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight to find that we have to look into the mystery of why cobb has been in exile and this plot has to do with his wife marion cotillard with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing this is to me where the movie essentially falls apart it seems like nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa at no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa and in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where cobb shows his new assistant ariadne ellen page too green to hold up her role a lot of the action becomes outright tedious never more so than when were treated to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snowmobile and gunfight action right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax it all starts to feel very obligatory and nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like funas a basic actionheist movie with scifi premise it still works well enough that i would recommend it as a rental nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level such as the association with totems and icons the spinning wheel etc and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity however when all the pieces are laid out the film seems overly simple and mechanical the plot is just this  the guy takes a job he does the job he gets to reunite with his kids although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to cillian murphys character even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of ken watanabes character i was hoping that some larger picture would emerge but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic the constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel i was watching a bad spielberg film the entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true spielberg fashion if you dont buy into this ridiculous softtarget hook then the whole film collapses like dicaprios dream worldthis isnt a bad or stupid film but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor which is almost always missing from nolans films the characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously basically this is like total recall in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes except that it takes itself hugely seriously it does not become a better film by doing so nor a more intelligent one\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " this review is being written by a  yearold guy i mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie moreand can take the fastpaced action and frenetic pace i assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film just something to consider as you read thisas for the movie ill be up front about the fact that i did not love this film its just not the sort of movie id usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go i am glad i did however as i really could respect the movie in many ways first the story is wildly original though also quite confusing other than the matrix films i cant think of anything that even comes close to it in style second the production looked and sounded great the music was intense and worked great with the amazing totally amazing special effects third it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are not lightweights and could act leonardo dicaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in titanichis maturity and grit were welcome also seeing the kid from third rock suddenly playing an action hero was greatyoud barely recognize himor the other grown child actors fourth i loved the endingit really pulled everything together very wellso why am i not giving the film a glowing review well i am simply not an action film fan and the insane pace tons of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times i much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film also while ken watanabe is a fine actor i had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he saidto the point where i wish theyd either dubbed him or had caption now this is not just because i am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearingmy daughter too found his thick accent difficult on the other hand ms cotillard was very easy to understand and i was surprised how well she controlled her lovely french accenti could probably go on and on about the filmas its long complex and very prone to be one to watch and rewatch and discuss with friends however at this point there are already a bazillion reviews and  billion people have already gone to see it so ill call it a daywell worth seeingbut perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future this is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows avatar be damnedof course a film is not complete without the actors leo dicaprio delivers an oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort shutter island he shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons joseph gordonlevitt ellen page tom hardy ken watanabe dileep rao cillian murphy tom berenger michael caine marion cottilard pete postlethwaite lukas haas nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownnolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film his direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating the detailed and complex original script is no surprise from nolan considering the fact that he turned batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago the dark knight the action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds the visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch the cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations hans zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all i have to say together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearchristopher nolan has once again outdone himself he truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in hollywood today and inception can proudly stand alongside blade runner and  a space odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherthere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct movie magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots movie of summer  movie of  heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade nolan is a genius and i applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peoplemissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeoverall value  excellent\n",

            " i have been reading nothing but good reviews on inception these past few weeks now i knew from the minute i saw the trailer i had to see this movie but i didnt know what to expect if you have seen the trailer to this movie you know that it doesnt explain too much but i saw inception today and all i can say is wow with an incredible cast and amazing director you just cant go wrong inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen its a very clever story that is told with skill and passion while you do have to pay attention i loved that it made me think one of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it but i didnt get that when i saw it today but i would love to see the movie again i have no problem with that between the performances the story the sounds the editing and the incredible effects i would love to watch this movie over and over again its my favorite film of the year so fardom cobb is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved now cobb is being offered a chance at redemption one last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception he gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off teaching new comer ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams even after all the lessons instead of the perfect heist cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant oneto write a dream is a riddle i love the way this movie was written christopher nolan is one of my new favorite directors he knows exactly how to write and tell a story the only small flaw this is a very small complaint is that his stories while theyre incredible can also be a bit exhausting this film is a bit long to warn you in advance its a little over two and a half hours long i felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed but like i said its such a small complaint because inception intrigued me so much to say that this film will be a contender for the oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound script editing and effects hopefully i think it might be a runner up for best pictureone of the things i hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because i dont want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it but honestly i dont think there isnt one person i wouldnt recommend this movie too inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing the matrix and the dark knight i think the zero gravity fight scene is one of the most amazing moments ive seen on the big screen i loved how the story kept you thinking and going guessing what would happen next and what was going on a dream within a dream within a dream you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality with a great cast and excellent director inception is everything i wanted and more once again nolan created a masterpiece something from his own mind inception questions yours and makes you wonder which world you are part of\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and

            " my rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardfor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent  years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable worksmemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inceptionspoilers ahead  for all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the  biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these  layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and  A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer  Movie of  Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent

            " im nearly at a loss for words just when you thought christopher nolan couldnt follow up to the dark knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next that is a real powerful skill a director has no wonder warner bros put their trust in him he is that good of a director and overhyping a christopher nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like many films beforenot since the eras of stanley kubrick andrei tarkovsky and alfred hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than christopher nolan he is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and gifted hollywood filmmakers in history filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime he has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time and yes it is similar to the excellent anime film paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as nolan brings the film to a whole different levelvisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts gi joe transformers or the exact opposite doubt invictus in this film the excellently

            " inception is written produced and directed by christopher nolan the film stars leonardo dicaprio ken watanabe joseph gordonlevitt marion cotillard ellen page tom hardy cillian murphy dileep rao tom berenger and michael caine the musical score is by hans zimmer and wally pfister is the cinematographer plot finds dicaprio playing dom cobb a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people but one day he gets a different offer one that will enable him to see his estranged children to get his reward he must enact inception the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target but inception is thought impossible and should cobb and his selected team fail the consequences are unthinkablethere has already been much written and pondered about as regards inception in the relatively short running time of its life one can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time for although its arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of  a space odyssey its inescapable that nolans movie is this current generations scifi classic that nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanshipinception is a film that its better to know nothing about before venturing into it and then it asks well nolan asks for your undivided attention its neither as confusing as some have painted it nor does it have any trickspeek behind the curtain typeup its sleeve the truth is is that inception has something for everyone thematically speaking and thats before we pore over the special effects that sees nolan raising the bar considerably as is the case with twisty high concept movies interpretations are many with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie what forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over theres also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with that of course wont work for everyone but that is just one of many strands that nolan dangles for the discerning viewerif that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the super hero genre rest assured thrill seekers inception is also a loud swirly spectacle the action is raucous be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled rollercoaster ride aided superbly by lee smiths editing and pfisters perfectly broad photography while zimmers score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains exsmiths guitarist johnny marr on  string to craft one of the best scores of  as i said theres something for everyone here making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbusterthen theres the strong ensemble cast led by a quite scintillating performance from dicaprio following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in shutter island dicaprio has given  two of its best lead performances here he gives real depth of emotion the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on his unfussy acting is easy to buy into giving the character the air of believability he is the glue that binds the whole film together murphy is wonderfully vulnerable very much an axis in the narrative while levitt almost usurps dicaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it special praise too for ellen page still in her early s she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress hands while hardy provides brawny levity and berenger leaves a favourable markthe matrix meets heat and mission impossible only its written by phillip k dick and richard matheson or something like that a cracking hybrid movie thats fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings \n",

            " i saw memento very recently something that turned out to be a great missi saw it again just to make a couple of thins straightand ill definitely do the same with inceptionchristopher nolan keeps improving himself with even more complex and multilayer script like thisand i thought memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers but noinception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius thats hidden behind itand not just directors and screenwriters or with other wordsnolan but with acting and soundand effects and editing as wellwhen you have a cast like thisi mean leonardo dicaprio joseph gordonlewitt michael caine or marion cotillard a personal favourite the movie just keeps going flawlesslymost of the crew is the same the nolan brothers worked with on tdk and earlier in batman beginsso the oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for methe only thing one could have against the movie is the headache one could havesee most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action they enjoyed iron man  and the ateam but this movieyou have to see it at least twice to understand itthe levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many that one surelyll miss something vitalthis is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience but i hope that wont happen because nolan is one of my favourite directorswriters and he showed that the brainless action flicks arent all of itthere are still movies like inception out there and still people like the nolans to make those movies so its not all lostand i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive not the endless constant explosionsbecause this is really a one of a lifetime eventsaying that i must say that in a world full of remakes reboots sequels prequels and god knows what this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so fara strong movie that surely will be nolans latest masterpiece my grade wont changeits the same for all nolan moviessheer \n",

            " surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely on the viewers intellect though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a pandoras box making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible this facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors but not to the genius of christopher nolan who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of science fiction in his latest wonder named inception nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called memento he further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like insomnia the prestige batman begins and the dark knight his unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag which gave him the carte blanche that a storyteller like nolan desperately needs its highly apparent that nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming inception inception is not only dreamlike but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen with its entwined layers the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential it incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts in fact the balance between human emotions and the elements of science fiction is so adequate that its impossible to separate themthe movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious in the dream state his proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wifes untimely death he is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children his only chance for redemption lies with a japanese tycoon named saitu who wants him to do an inception planting information into someones mind in order to accomplish this unprecedented task cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundityleonardo dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role following his memorable performance in shutter island he has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of cobbs enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma marion cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as cobbs whimsical wife mal the rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of ken watanabe ellen page and joseph gordonlevittinception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema nolans creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet but whether it would become buñuels un chien andalou or kubricks  a space odyssey and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide irrespectively inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado but also for the average viewer who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delightps one has to imagine it to believe it httpwwwapotpourriofvestigescom\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird inception is no exception to that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion ie the matrix  the cell  abre los ojos   its american remake vanilla sky  you really cant look away nor should youinception is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the summer of  that lives up to its hype it is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll the less you know about this movie going in the more you will be entranced by seeing itleonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb a world class criminal who with the help of a team of sleep experts works his way into peoples subconscious and steals what people value most ideas directly from their minds in his last assignment to possibly clear his name he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone but to plant one inside that persons mind the difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being takenthat plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe dicaprio is good in his role but unlike many other films he has starred in this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other costar instead this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist joseph gordonlevitt ellen page and tom hardy are especially good in their rolesthe special effects in this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the matrix movies there are slowmotion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences its especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams and impossible sequences are filmed in a way ive never seen other than in drawingshowever the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasnt good for this reason even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film the credit here can be given to writer and director christopher nolan who has not made a bad film yet there are many twists and turns in this film but nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story if nolan does not get nominated for best director andor best original screenplay next oscar season there is something terribly wrong with the academythat being said there was still a lot about this film i still dont get and may require multiple viewings to better understand however some of the best films ive seen are confusing at first  a space odyssey  is a film ive seen a couple of times and still dont understand completely it still has a major following though as im positive this movie will its an incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as

            " id like to keep my review rather to the pointpros  its theme  dream is a fascinating topic to say the least there are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld its plot  there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns its edgy drive  although you know whats coming next still you feel jumpy about it when it does its rapid storyline  the story moves fast from one scene to another making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride at times its hard to keep up even after watching it several times its sophistication  there is a lot of information to remember and digest this is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after i believe its realism  okay pun intended the movie explains or at least tries to the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions some of which are very familiar with and dear to uscons  its poor character development  although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development i wonder how many people really felt connected to the main characters after watching the movie yes the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else if you ask me too many distractions  i found that the movie had more characters than necessary they may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else i wish the movie was more focused a bit preachy  i noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie im afraid inception overused this trickin conclusion its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvementi highly recommend you to go and read somewhere carnal over  winks if you dig this kind of flickscheers\n",

            " the film is a disappointment because it did so little with so much basically what you have here is a very interesting scifi heist premise cobb leonardo dicaprio and arthur joseph gordonlevitt are partners who use dreaminvasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise while they doze in exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against cobb they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission to practice inception on a powerful business scion that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulationall of this is great but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight to find that we have to look into the mystery of why cobb has been in exile and this plot has to do with his wife marion cotillard with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing this is to me where the movie essentially falls apart it seems like nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa at no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa and in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where cobb shows his new assistant ariadne ellen page too green to hold up her role a lot of the action becomes outright tedious never more so than when were treated to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snowmobile and gunfight action right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax it all starts to feel very obligatory and nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like funas a basic actionheist movie with scifi premise it still works well enough that i would recommend it as a rental nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level such as the association with totems and icons the spinning wheel etc and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity however when all the pieces are laid out the film seems overly simple and mechanical the plot is just this  the guy takes a job he does the job he gets to reunite with his kids although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to cillian murphys character even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of ken watanabes character i was hoping that some larger picture would emerge but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic the constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel i was watching a bad spielberg film the entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true spielberg fashion if you dont buy into this ridiculous softtarget hook then the whole film collapses like dicaprios dream worldthis isnt a bad or stupid film but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor which is almost always missing from nolans films the characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously basically this is like total recall in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes except that it takes itself hugely seriously it does not become a better film by doing so nor a more intelligent one\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes And for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " this review is being written by a  yearold guy i mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie moreand can take the fastpaced action and frenetic pace i assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film just something to consider as you read thisas for the movie ill be up front about the fact that i did not love this film its just not the sort of movie id usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go i am glad i did however as i really could respect the movie in many ways first the story is wildly original though also quite confusing other than the matrix films i cant think of anything that even comes close to it in style second the production looked and sounded great the music was intense and worked great with the amazing totally amazing special effects third it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are not lightweights and could act leonardo dicaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in titanichis maturity and grit were welcome also seeing the kid from third rock suddenly playing an action hero was greatyoud barely recognize himor the other grown child actors fourth i loved the endingit really pulled everything together very wellso why am i not giving the film a glowing review well i am simply not an action film fan and the insane pace tons of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times i much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film also while ken watanabe is a fine actor i had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he saidto the point where i wish theyd either dubbed him or had caption now this is not just because i am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearingmy daughter too found his thick accent difficult on the other hand ms cotillard was very easy to understand and i was surprised how well she controlled her lovely french accenti could probably go on and on about the filmas its long complex and very prone to be one to watch and rewatch and discuss with friends however at this point there are already a bazillion reviews and  billion people have already gone to see it so ill call it a daywell worth seeingbut perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future this is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows avatar be damnedof course a film is not complete without the actors leo dicaprio delivers an oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort shutter island he shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons joseph gordonlevitt ellen page tom hardy ken watanabe dileep rao cillian murphy tom berenger michael caine marion cottilard pete postlethwaite lukas haas nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownnolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film his direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating the detailed and complex original script is no surprise from nolan considering the fact that he turned batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago the dark knight the action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds the visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch the cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations hans zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all i have to say together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearchristopher nolan has once again outdone himself he truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in hollywood today and inception can proudly stand alongside blade runner and  a space odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherthere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct movie magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots movie of summer  movie of  heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade nolan is a genius and i applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peoplemissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeoverall value  excellent\n",

            " i have been reading nothing but good reviews on inception these past few weeks now i knew from the minute i saw the trailer i had to see this movie but i didnt know what to expect if you have seen the trailer to this movie you know that it doesnt explain too much but i saw inception today and all i can say is wow with an incredible cast and amazing director you just cant go wrong inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen its a very clever story that is told with skill and passion while you do have to pay attention i loved that it made me think one of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it but i didnt get that when i saw it today but i would love to see the movie again i have no problem with that between the performances the story the sounds the editing and the incredible effects i would love to watch this movie over and over again its my favorite film of the year so fardom cobb is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved now cobb is being offered a chance at redemption one last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception he gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off teaching new comer ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams even after all the lessons instead of the perfect heist cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant oneto write a dream is a riddle i love the way this movie was written christopher nolan is one of my new favorite directors he knows exactly how to write and tell a story the only small flaw this is a very small complaint is that his stories while theyre incredible can also be a bit exhausting this film is a bit long to warn you in advance its a little over two and a half hours long i felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed but like i said its such a small complaint because inception intrigued me so much to say that this film will be a contender for the oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound script editing and effects hopefully i think it might be a runner up for best pictureone of the things i hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because i dont want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it but honestly i dont think there isnt one person i wouldnt recommend this movie too inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing the matrix and the dark knight i think the zero gravity fight scene is one of the most amazing moments ive seen on the big screen i loved how the story kept you thinking and going guessing what would happen next and what was going on a dream within a dream within a dream you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality with a great cast and excellent director inception is everything i wanted and more once again nolan created a masterpiece something from his own mind inception questions yours and makes you wonder which world you are part of\n",

            " My 3rd time watching this movie Yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardFor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen As its been done so sophisticatedly I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception In my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolans remarkable worksMemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film Ive ever seen But overall it doesnt reach the same level of InceptionThe Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I havent been able to find the very particular Nolans spirit in itThe Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well Nonetheless every time we talk about it Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole The uniqueandonly JokerThen there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way The multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting From visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow Nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them I believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in Paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing In addition Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messagesLater we had Interstellar Though I did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of InceptionSPOILERS AHEAD  For all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersIt is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream There is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world Our hero Mr Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner Arthur Joseph GordonLevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  Mr Saito Ken Watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception In return Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission Eames Tom Hardy  a veteran identity forger Yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and Ariadne Ellen Page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission The target is Robert Fischer Cillian Murphy  son and heir of Saitos biggest competitor Maurice Fischer whos dying The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of Cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionThe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life In Cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal Marion Cotillard and his regrets So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission Indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense Yes Were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world Or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission When we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job Cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters And after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live So from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifeSome short lines about the castLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood DiamondJoseph GordonLevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequenceThere was something missing in Ken Watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission Maybe it was his EnglishTom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeEllen Page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect And personally I did find a lot of charms in her actingCillian Murphy has also done a great job Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character Robert Fischer at the end was not so different than our hero Cobb They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze If for Cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for Fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadLast but not least the one who impressed me the most was Marion Mal was so beautiful and

            " my rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterwardfor someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent  years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable worksmemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inceptionspoilers ahead  for all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of stealing he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the  biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these  layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his lifesome short lines about the castleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie\n",

            " Im nearly at a loss for words Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldnt follow up to The Dark Knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next That is a real powerful skill a director has No wonder Warner Bros put their trust in him he is THAT good of a director and overhyping a Christopher Nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films beforeNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan He is undoubtedly one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime He has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time And yes it is similar to the excellent anime film Paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different levelVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts GI Joe Transformers or the exact opposite Doubt Invictus In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jawdropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believabilityAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and 2001 A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer 2010 Movie of 2010 Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent peopleMissing this film and not getting the films point is a crimeOverall value 910 Excellent\n",

cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio Warner Bros this film is a very personal film for Nolan he wrote the film as well as directing it and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolans perplexing increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher rather it is a film for thinkers Honestly I cant explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed confused and ultimately breathless Its like a puzzle both physically and mentally and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the films humanity and this is where Inception shines It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come Thats right yearsOnce the film ends youll want to watch it again for theres something new every time This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the films ambiguous themes and will be discussed by many in the future This is an original film no adaptation no sequelprequel no remakereboot which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows Avatar be damnedOf course a film is not complete without the actors Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance similar but better than his previous effort Shutter Island He shows glimpses of a flawed grim fragile man who has knowledge about everything else but yet cant seem to come in grips with himself and his demons Joseph GordonLevitt Ellen Page Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Dileep Rao Cillian Murphy Tom Berenger Michael Caine Marion Cottilard Pete Postlethwaite Lukas Haas Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their ownNolan is of course a master behind the camera a real virtuoso when it comes to film His direction is taut focused gripping and extraordinarily fascinating The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into popculture art two years ago The Dark Knight The action sequences are unique exciting and fresh something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds The visual effects are awesome and imaginative and best of all they do not bring down the movies quality one bit rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch The cinematography is absolutely beautifully shot so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory Production design is top notch with terrific design of sets and locations Hans Zimmers complementing music score is simply outstanding and knowing the man thats really all I have to say Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this yearChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself He truly is a gifted filmmaker arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today And Inception can proudly stand alongside Blade Runner and  A Space Odyssey as sciencefiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogetherThere are two types of films the crowdpleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indieart film Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package pulling off that rare now nearlyextinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots Movie of Summer  Movie of  Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent

            " im nearly at a loss for words just when you thought christopher nolan couldnt follow up to the dark knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird but nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just cant help watching and wondering what will happen next that is a real powerful skill a director has no wonder warner bros put their trust in him he is that good of a director and overhyping a christopher nolan film no matter what the film is about is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like many films beforenot since the eras of stanley kubrick andrei tarkovsky and alfred hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than christopher nolan he is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant and gifted hollywood filmmakers in history filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime he has the ability to seduce our eyes ears and most importantly mind and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time and yes it is similar to the excellent anime film paprika in the whole invading dreams plot but the similarities end there as nolan brings the film to a whole different levelvisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time its either allvisualsnosmarts gi joe transformers or the exact opposite doubt invictus in this film the excellently

            " inception is written produced and directed by christopher nolan the film stars leonardo dicaprio ken watanabe joseph gordonlevitt marion cotillard ellen page tom hardy cillian murphy dileep rao tom berenger and michael caine the musical score is by hans zimmer and wally pfister is the cinematographer plot finds dicaprio playing dom cobb a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people but one day he gets a different offer one that will enable him to see his estranged children to get his reward he must enact inception the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target but inception is thought impossible and should cobb and his selected team fail the consequences are unthinkablethere has already been much written and pondered about as regards inception in the relatively short running time of its life one can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time for although its arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of  a space odyssey its inescapable that nolans movie is this current generations scifi classic that nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanshipinception is a film that its better to know nothing about before venturing into it and then it asks well nolan asks for your undivided attention its neither as confusing as some have painted it nor does it have any trickspeek behind the curtain typeup its sleeve the truth is is that inception has something for everyone thematically speaking and thats before we pore over the special effects that sees nolan raising the bar considerably as is the case with twisty high concept movies interpretations are many with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie what forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over theres also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with that of course wont work for everyone but that is just one of many strands that nolan dangles for the discerning viewerif that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the super hero genre rest assured thrill seekers inception is also a loud swirly spectacle the action is raucous be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled rollercoaster ride aided superbly by lee smiths editing and pfisters perfectly broad photography while zimmers score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains exsmiths guitarist johnny marr on  string to craft one of the best scores of  as i said theres something for everyone here making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbusterthen theres the strong ensemble cast led by a quite scintillating performance from dicaprio following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in shutter island dicaprio has given  two of its best lead performances here he gives real depth of emotion the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on his unfussy acting is easy to buy into giving the character the air of believability he is the glue that binds the whole film together murphy is wonderfully vulnerable very much an axis in the narrative while levitt almost usurps dicaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it special praise too for ellen page still in her early s she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress hands while hardy provides brawny levity and berenger leaves a favourable markthe matrix meets heat and mission impossible only its written by phillip k dick and richard matheson or something like that a cracking hybrid movie thats fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings \n",

            " i saw memento very recently something that turned out to be a great missi saw it again just to make a couple of thins straightand ill definitely do the same with inceptionchristopher nolan keeps improving himself with even more complex and multilayer script like thisand i thought memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers but noinception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius thats hidden behind itand not just directors and screenwriters or with other wordsnolan but with acting and soundand effects and editing as wellwhen you have a cast like thisi mean leonardo dicaprio joseph gordonlewitt michael caine or marion cotillard a personal favourite the movie just keeps going flawlesslymost of the crew is the same the nolan brothers worked with on tdk and earlier in batman beginsso the oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for methe only thing one could have against the movie is the headache one could havesee most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action they enjoyed iron man  and the ateam but this movieyou have to see it at least twice to understand itthe levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many that one surelyll miss something vitalthis is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience but i hope that wont happen because nolan is one of my favourite directorswriters and he showed that the brainless action flicks arent all of itthere are still movies like inception out there and still people like the nolans to make those movies so its not all lostand i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive not the endless constant explosionsbecause this is really a one of a lifetime eventsaying that i must say that in a world full of remakes reboots sequels prequels and god knows what this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so fara strong movie that surely will be nolans latest masterpiece my grade wont changeits the same for all nolan moviessheer \n",

            " surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely on the viewers intellect though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a pandoras box making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible this facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors but not to the genius of christopher nolan who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of science fiction in his latest wonder named inception nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called memento he further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like insomnia the prestige batman begins and the dark knight his unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag which gave him the carte blanche that a storyteller like nolan desperately needs its highly apparent that nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming inception inception is not only dreamlike but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen with its entwined layers the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential it incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts in fact the balance between human emotions and the elements of science fiction is so adequate that its impossible to separate themthe movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious in the dream state his proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wifes untimely death he is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children his only chance for redemption lies with a japanese tycoon named saitu who wants him to do an inception planting information into someones mind in order to accomplish this unprecedented task cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundityleonardo dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role following his memorable performance in shutter island he has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of cobbs enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma marion cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as cobbs whimsical wife mal the rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of ken watanabe ellen page and joseph gordonlevittinception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema nolans creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet but whether it would become buñuels un chien andalou or kubricks  a space odyssey and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide irrespectively inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado but also for the average viewer who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delightps one has to imagine it to believe it httpwwwapotpourriofvestigescom\n",
